# VIVADO AUTOMATION 
This project aims to automate Xilinx Vivado Tool from creation of file to generation of results. A basic Tcl build script replicates the typical FPGA workflow of synthesis, place, route, and write bitstream. The whole build takes place in memory without creating project files, so itâ€™s faster than building in the GUI. The project uses various libraries from python like pandas, numpy and also VS studio to run them.

- It imports the required libraries: os, pandas and numpy
- It lists all the Verilog  files in the directory.
- It creates a new Vivado project using a Tcl script.
- It adds the Verilog and System Verilog files to the project using another Tcl script.
- It creates directories for storing Power, Timing, and Utilization reports for each top module.
- It runs synthesis and implementation for each top module using a Tcl script.
- It reads the timing and power reports and extracts the required values.
- It prints the obtained values and writes them to csv file.
